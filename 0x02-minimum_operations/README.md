# Concepts Needed

## Dynamic Programming
Familiarity with dynamic programming can help in breaking down the problem into simpler subproblems and building up the solution. [Dynamic Programming (GeeksforGeeks)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dynamic-programming/)

## Prime Factorization
Understanding how to perform prime factorization is crucial since the problem can be reduced to finding the sum of the prime factors of the target number _n_. [Prime Factorization (Khan Academy)](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/algebra/x2f8bb11595b61c86:fractions/x2f8bb11595b61c86:prime-factorization/v/prime-factorization)

## Code Optimization
Knowing how to approach problems from an optimization perspective can be useful in finding the most efficient solution. [How to optimize Python code](https://realpython.com/optimizing-python-code/)

## Greedy Algorithms
The problem can also be approached with greedy algorithms, choosing the best option at each step. [Greedy Algorithms (GeeksforGeeks)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/greedy-algorithms/)

## Basic Python Programming
Proficiency in Python, including loops, conditionals, and functions, is necessary to implement the solution. [Python Functions (Python Official Documentation)](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html#defining-functions)

By studying these concepts and utilizing the resources provided, you will be equipped to tackle the “Minimum Operations” problem effectively, applying both mathematical reasoning and programming skills to find the most efficient solution.
