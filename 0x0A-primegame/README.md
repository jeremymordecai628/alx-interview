**Understanding the Prime Number Game**

The prime number game is a strategic game where two players take turns removing numbers from a set of consecutive integers. A player can only remove a prime number or a multiple of a prime number. The player who removes the last number wins.

**Key Concepts:**

1. **Prime Numbers:** Numbers that are only divisible by 1 and themselves.
2. **Sieve of Eratosthenes:** An efficient algorithm to find all prime numbers up to a given limit.
3. **Game Theory:** The study of strategic decision-making in competitive situations.

**Winning Strategy:**

To win the game, a player needs to carefully consider their moves and force the opponent into unfavorable positions. A well-thought-out strategy involves:

1. **Identifying Prime Numbers:** Quickly identifying prime numbers in the remaining set.
2. **Strategic Removal:** Removing numbers that either lead directly to a win or limit the opponent's options.
3. **Anticipating Opponent's Moves:** Predicting the opponent's potential moves and planning accordingly.

**Implementing the Game:**

1. **Generate Prime Numbers:** Use the Sieve of Eratosthenes to generate a list of prime numbers within a specific range.
2. **Game Loop:** 
   - Alternate turns between players.
   - Each player selects and removes a valid number from the set.
   - Check for a win condition (if the set is empty).
3. **Optimal Move:** Implement a strategy to determine the best move for each player. This might involve using techniques like minimax or other game theory algorithms.

By understanding the game's rules, utilizing efficient algorithms, and employing strategic thinking, you can develop a winning strategy for the prime number game.
